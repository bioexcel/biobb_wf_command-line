    "**Biomolecular workflows** built using **BioExcel building blocks** (biobb) can be launched in **command line** (without Jupyter or iPython interactivity) with a combination of a **Python script** and a separated **yaml formatted file** containing the **input parameters**. This approximation combines the power of the **scripting in Python** with the **interoperability** of **biomolecular simulation workflows** provided by the **BioExcel building blocks**, and is the one used in **production** runs. \n",

In the **first steps** section, the **main points** to take into account when building a **command line workflow** will be introduced, using as example the first 2 steps of the **Protein MD Setup**. In the **Protein MD Setup command-line workflow** section, the complete workflow presented in the [Jupyter Notebook tutorial](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_wf_md_setup) will be translated to a **Python script + yaml-formatted file** to launch it in a **command-line interface**.

    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebooks** are fantastic tools to explore and play with software, and in particular, with the **BioExcel building blocks** library. But when a workflow is ready to start with **production**, or it needs to be expanded with more complex **loop/conditional** structures, the best option is to move from a **GUI** to a **command line** execution. In **command line** is where the **real power** of the **BioExcel building blocks** unleashes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going from a **Jupyter Notebook** to a **command line python script** is as easy as **exporting** the notebook to a **Python script** (Menu --> File --> Download as --> Python (.py) ). The **downloaded Python script** will be executable just typing *python name_of_the_notebook.py* (in our case, *python biobb_MDsetup_tutorial.py*). Remember that for the script to properly work, the library modules should have been **previously installed** in your  **conda environment**, following the **Protein MD tutorial** installation steps (*Conda Installation and Launch*). \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving from the **Jupyter environment** to a **command line**, we are going to miss the **interactivity** and the possibility to use **graphical support** such as 3D structure viewers or plot representation. But it will offer us a jump to the **High Throughput** (HT) regime. Many different instances of the workflow can be launched at the same time with different inputs. Command line executions are offering us **automation and repetition**. However, when a particular **input file** or **step parameter** needs to be changed, the main **Python script** should be changed. That's why the **BioExcel building blocks workflows** are divided in **two files**:\n",
    "\n",

    "* **Configuration file** (YAML): Input files (paths) and parameters for all the different steps of the workflow.\n",

As input parameters all the **building blocks** are prepared to receive the **paths** (inputs and outputs) and the **properties** (input parameters). As we already have previously read all this data and stored it in the **conf_inputs** and **conf_properties** variables, we can now use them to extract the corresponding **step inputs**, using the **name (id)** of each **step** as a **key**. To be compatible with the format accepted by the **building blocks**, the **input paths** should be **expanded** (using the Python **prefix operator to unpack dictionaries **). Thus, the **paths** for the **step1** are passed as an argument using its expanded version: **conf_inputs[\"step1_pdb\"]**. Oppositely, the **properties** of each step are passed directly: **properties=conf_properties[\"step1_pdb\"]**. This syntax is repeated for **all of the steps** in the workflow. "

The example used is taken from the **Protein MD Setup** [Jupyter Notebook](http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/biobb/availability/tutorials/md_setup) tutorial. It is **strongly recommended** to take a look at this notebook before moving on to the next sections of this tutorial, as it contains information for all the **building blocks** used. The aim of this tutorial is to illustrate how to build a **command line workflow** using the **BioExcel building blocks**. For information about the science behind every step of the workflow, please refer to the **Protein MD Setup** Jupyter Notebook tutorial. The workflow presented in the next cells is a translation of the very same workflow to **Python + YAML files**, including the same number of steps (23) and **building blocks**.\n",

    "* **Fill the Box with Water Molecules**: step 5\n",
    "* **Adding Ions**: steps 6 and 7\n",
    "* **Energetically Minimize the System**: steps 8, 9 and 10\n",
    "* **Equilibrate the System (NVT)**: steps 11, 12 and 13\n",
    "* **Equilibrate the System (NPT)**: steps 14, 15 and 16\n",
